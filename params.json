  "body": "# symlinkgcc\r\n\r\nOS X ships with `/usr/bin/gcc` not actually `gcc`, but `clang`. This will cause Makefile's relying on gcc-specific flags to fail. The `gcc` in `homebrew-core` installs to `/usr/local/bin/gcc-{major_version}`, for example `/usr/local/bin/gcc-6`. This (super) simple script symlinks `/usr/local/bin/gcc` to the latest version of `gcc`.\r\n\r\n# Using as a formula dependency\r\n\r\nIf your formula's Makefile/compile script uses gcc-specific functionality, just add this dependency line to ensure that `gcc` is actually `gcc` and not `clang`:\r\n```\r\ndepends_on \"thepiercingarrow/homebrew-tap/symlinkgcc\" => :build\r\n```\r\n# Installing for self use\r\n\r\nIf you are tired of typing `gcc-{version}` to use `gcc`, or changing your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` every time `gcc` releases a new major version, just:\r\n```\r\nbrew install symlinkgcc\r\n```\r\nand `/usr/local/bin/gcc` will automatically update whenever `gcc` updates (assuming you keep `gcc` updated using `brew upgrade`).\r\n",
